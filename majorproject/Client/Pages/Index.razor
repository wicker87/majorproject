        <h5>
            Risk Assessment is a systematic process of evaluating the probability<br /> 
            and consequences of potential risks that may be involved in a<br />
            projected activity. It is essential in workplace safety and<br />
            health management to identify and analyse hazards,<br />
            and determine the appropriate control measures.
